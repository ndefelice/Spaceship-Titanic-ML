# Spaceship Titanic Machine Learning Project
This is my first ever machine learning project! "Spaceship Titanic" is an ongoing competition created by the Kaggle platform and is open to all users. "Spaceship Titanic" is a fictional interstellar liner that launched 13,000 passengers into space during the year 2912, but when the space shuttle collides with a space anomaly about half of the passengers are transported to an alternate dimension. Using records from the spaceship's computer system, the goal is to predict which passengers were transported by the accident.

About two thirds of the records contain information about a passenger and whether they were transported or not. This data will be used to train our model. Meanwhile, the remaining one third of records contain the same information about a passenger, excluding whether they were transported or not. This data will be used by Kaggle to test our model and give it an accuracy score.

Using Python, I trained a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict transported passengers with 77.577% accuracy.

This is a great competition for beginners that want to become more familiar with machine learning. I provided a link to the competition below:

Kaggle has a variety of machine learning competitions for programmers of all skill levels. The platform also provides useful datasets, discussion boards, and machine learning courses. Here's a link to their website for those who may be interested:
